# Tensoris

**High-performance neural inference and numerical computing in C++**

---

## Overview

**Tensoris** is a C++ project focused on building efficient, modular neural network inference systems and numerical computation tools from scratch. Born as a learning initiative, the project explores low-level implementation of core ML concepts with an emphasis on speed, control, and clarity. While still in early development, Tensoris aims to evolve into a flexible, high-performance engine for systems-level machine learning experimentation.

## Features (Planned and In Progress)

- [ ] Minimal neural network framework (forward pass, layers, activations)
- [ ] Manual memory management and allocator control
- [ ] Inference engine for small, fixed-size feedforward models
- [ ] Modular architecture for extensions (backprop, quantization, GPU)
- [ ] Performance benchmarking tools

---

## Getting Started

_Tensoris is currently under active development. Setup instructions and build configuration (CMake, etc.) will be added soon._

---

## Roadmap

1. Build out a minimal tensor structure with basic ops
2. Implement a forward-only neural network
3. Begin integrating financial math modules from F.A.S.T.E.R.
4. Add testing and benchmarking tools
5. Explore parallelization and hardware acceleration
